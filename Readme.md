## Overview
This is a **Flask-based web application** for **handwritten digit recognition** with models trained on the MNIST dataset. Users can select from multiple models and draw digits on a canvas to get predictions. The models are hosted on **Hugging Face** and integrated via an API.

## Features
- **Multiple Model Options:** Choose from **CNN (Recommended), SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest**.
- **Model Insights:** View the **heatmap** and **classification report** for each model.
- **Canvas for Digit Input:** Users can draw digits on an interactive canvas.
- **Real-time Prediction:** The app predicts digits and provides accuracy scores.
- **Accuracy Chart:** Displays the accuracy of the predicted digits.
- **Hosted Models:** Models are served via an **API hosted on Hugging Face**.
- **Deployed Online:** Access the live demo at [Render Deployment](https://digit-recognizer-i0xj.onrender.com/).
